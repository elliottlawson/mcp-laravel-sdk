# Laravel-Native SSE Implementation

This document outlines the improvements made to the Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation in the Laravel MCP SDK to better align with Laravel 12 conventions and request lifecycle.

## Key Improvements

1. **Laravel Request Lifecycle Integration**
   - Properly uses `StreamedResponse` from Symfony (which Laravel uses internally)
   - Respects Laravel's middleware and response preparation
   - Integrates with Laravel's event system

2. **Clean Architecture**
   - Follows Laravel 12 conventions with constructor property promotion
   - Uses proper dependency injection
   - Provides a dedicated service provider

3. **Better Event Handling**
   - Dispatches Laravel events for connection lifecycle events
   - Provides hooks for application code to respond to SSE events
   - Maintains clean separation of concerns

4. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Better logging of connection issues
   - Graceful termination of connections
   - Proper cleanup of resources

## Implementation Details

### LaravelNativeSseTransport

The new `LaravelNativeSseTransport` class replaces the older implementation with several improvements:

```php
// Creating a transport instance
$transport = new LaravelNativeSseTransport(
    $heartbeatInterval,
    $maxExecutionTime,
    $connectionId
);

// Creating a properly configured StreamedResponse
$response = $transport->createResponse(function ($transport) {
    // Setup code runs here before the stream starts
});
```

### SseServiceProvider

A dedicated service provider for SSE functionality:

```php
// In config/app.php or via auto-discovery
'providers' => [
    // ...
    ElliottLawson\LaravelMcp\Providers\SseServiceProvider::class,
],
```

### Controller Integration

The controller now uses the new transport in a more Laravel-native way:

```php
public function sse(Request $request): StreamedResponse
{
    // Create transport
    $transport = new LaravelNativeSseTransport(...);
    
    // Return a properly configured StreamedResponse
    return $transport->createResponse(function ($transport) {
        // Setup event listeners and other initialization
    });
}
```

## Event System

The implementation dispatches the following Laravel events:

- `mcp.sse.connected` - When a new SSE connection is established
- `mcp.sse.started` - When the SSE stream begins
- `mcp.sse.ready` - When the transport is ready to send messages
- `mcp.sse.message.sent` - When a message is sent through the transport
- `mcp.sse.heartbeat` - When a heartbeat is sent
- `mcp.sse.ended` - When the SSE stream ends
- `mcp.sse.disconnected` - When a client disconnects

## Benefits

1. **Better Integration**: Works seamlessly with Laravel's request handling
2. **Maintainability**: Follows Laravel conventions for easier maintenance
3. **Testability**: Easier to test with Laravel's testing tools
4. **Performance**: More efficient handling of connections
5. **Reliability**: More robust error handling and connection management
